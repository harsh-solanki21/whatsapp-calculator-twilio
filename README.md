## Hack of Cloud Native Hackathon

### Inspiration
- Integration of WhatsApp into the application was quite fascinating for me because I have not done WhatsApp integration before. So this was a inspiration for me to work on something like this and build something meaningful out of it.

### What it does
- It is basically a calculator in WhatsApp. Using this application, users can perform all the arithmetic operations in WhatsApp.

### How I built it
- I build it using Express JS, Twillio, and ngrok.
  - Express is the Backend technology.
  - Twilio used to integret WhatsApp with the application.
  - ngrok provides a real-time web UI where we can introspect all HTTP traffic running over our tunnels.

### Challenges I ran into
- Integration of WhatsApp with the application was quite a challenge but Twilio tutorial videos helped me a lot to resolve the errors and implement integration.

### Accomplishments that I am proud of
- I accomplished WhatsApp integration in my Web Application and implemented a calculator in WhatsApp itself.

### What I learned
- I learned about intergration of Twilio features like SMS, WhatsApp, Calling, etc. in the application.

### What's next for whatsapp-calculator-twilio
- I will try to upgrade this project in the future and will make it more strong in terms of features and functionalities.
